Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends.

Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain . If I encounter anything I will update here.So finally I am happy with this product, So I will suggest you to buy this product without any doubts. Thank you Samsung"

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends. So This battery lasts longer and I am happy. There is a feature for Samsung mobiles where we can set max charging limit to 85% , it improves battery life. Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain . If I encounter anything I will update here.So finally I am happy with this product, So I will suggest you to buy this product without any doubts. Thank you Samsung"

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.

I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends.

Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain .

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick.

Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends.

There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends. So This battery lasts longer and I am happy. There is a feature for Samsung mobiles where we can set max charging limit to 85% , it improves battery life. Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain . If I encounter anything I will update here.So finally I am happy with this product, So I will suggest you to buy this product without any doubts. Thank you Samsung"

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends. So This battery lasts longer and I am happy. There is a feature for Samsung mobiles where we can set max charging limit to 85% , it improves battery life. Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain . If I encounter anything I will update here.So finally I am happy with this product, So I will suggest you to buy this product without any doubts. Thank you Samsung"

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends. So This battery lasts longer and I am happy. There is a feature for Samsung mobiles where we can set max charging limit to 85% , it improves battery life. Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain . If I encounter anything I will update here.So finally I am happy with this product, So I will suggest you to buy this product without any doubts. Thank you Samsung"

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends.

Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain .

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends.

Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain . If I encounter anything I will update here.So finally I am happy with this product, So I will suggest you to buy this product without any doubts. Thank you Samsung"

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing.

It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big.

So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends. So This battery lasts longer and I am happy. There is a feature for Samsung mobiles where we can set max charging limit to 85% , it improves battery life. Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain . If I encounter anything I will update here.So finally I am happy with this product, So I will suggest you to buy this product without any doubts. Thank you Samsung"

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends. So This battery lasts longer and I am happy. There is a feature for Samsung mobiles where we can set max charging limit to 85% , it improves battery life. Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain . If I encounter anything I will update here.So finally I am happy with this product, So I will suggest you to buy this product without any doubts. Thank you Samsung"

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends. So This battery lasts longer and I am happy. There is a feature for Samsung mobiles where we can set max charging limit to 85% , it improves battery life. Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain . If I encounter anything I will update here.So finally I am happy with this product, So I will suggest you to buy this product without any doubts. Thank you Samsung"

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends.

Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain . If I encounter anything I will update here.So finally I am happy with this product, So I will suggest you to buy this product without any doubts. Thank you Samsung"

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends.

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing.

It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends. So This battery lasts longer and I am happy. There is a feature for Samsung mobiles where we can set max charging limit to 85% , it improves battery life. Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain . If I encounter anything I will update here.So finally I am happy with this product, So I will suggest you to buy this product without any doubts. Thank you Samsung"

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used.

In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends. So This battery lasts longer and I am happy. There is a feature for Samsung mobiles where we can set max charging limit to 85% , it improves battery life. Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain . If I encounter anything I will update here.So finally I am happy with this product, So I will suggest you to buy this product without any doubts. Thank you Samsung"

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung.

You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends. So This battery lasts longer and I am happy. There is a feature for Samsung mobiles where we can set max charging limit to 85% , it improves battery life. Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain . If I encounter anything I will update here.So finally I am happy with this product, So I will suggest you to buy this product without any doubts. Thank you Samsung"

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends. So This battery lasts longer and I am happy. There is a feature for Samsung mobiles where we can set max charging limit to 85% , it improves battery life. Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain .

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends.

Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain . If I encounter anything I will update here.So finally I am happy with this product, So I will suggest you to buy this product without any doubts. Thank you Samsung"

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types.

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends. So This battery lasts longer and I am happy. There is a feature for Samsung mobiles where we can set max charging limit to 85% , it improves battery life. Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain . If I encounter anything I will update here.So finally I am happy with this product, So I will suggest you to buy this product without any doubts. Thank you Samsung"

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends. So This battery lasts longer and I am happy. There is a feature for Samsung mobiles where we can set max charging limit to 85% , it improves battery life. Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain . If I encounter anything I will update here.So finally I am happy with this product, So I will suggest you to buy this product without any doubts. Thank you Samsung"

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.

I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends.

Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain .

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick.

Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends.

There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends. So This battery lasts longer and I am happy. There is a feature for Samsung mobiles where we can set max charging limit to 85% , it improves battery life. Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain . If I encounter anything I will update here.So finally I am happy with this product, So I will suggest you to buy this product without any doubts. Thank you Samsung"

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends. So This battery lasts longer and I am happy. There is a feature for Samsung mobiles where we can set max charging limit to 85% , it improves battery life. Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain . If I encounter anything I will update here.So finally I am happy with this product, So I will suggest you to buy this product without any doubts. Thank you Samsung"

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends. So This battery lasts longer and I am happy. There is a feature for Samsung mobiles where we can set max charging limit to 85% , it improves battery life. Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain . If I encounter anything I will update here.So finally I am happy with this product, So I will suggest you to buy this product without any doubts. Thank you Samsung"

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends.

Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain .

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends.

Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain . If I encounter anything I will update here.So finally I am happy with this product, So I will suggest you to buy this product without any doubts. Thank you Samsung"

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing.

It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big.

So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends. So This battery lasts longer and I am happy. There is a feature for Samsung mobiles where we can set max charging limit to 85% , it improves battery life. Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain . If I encounter anything I will update here.So finally I am happy with this product, So I will suggest you to buy this product without any doubts. Thank you Samsung"

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends. So This battery lasts longer and I am happy. There is a feature for Samsung mobiles where we can set max charging limit to 85% , it improves battery life. Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain . If I encounter anything I will update here.So finally I am happy with this product, So I will suggest you to buy this product without any doubts. Thank you Samsung"

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends. So This battery lasts longer and I am happy. There is a feature for Samsung mobiles where we can set max charging limit to 85% , it improves battery life. Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain . If I encounter anything I will update here.So finally I am happy with this product, So I will suggest you to buy this product without any doubts. Thank you Samsung"

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends.

Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain . If I encounter anything I will update here.So finally I am happy with this product, So I will suggest you to buy this product without any doubts. Thank you Samsung"

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends.

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing.

It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends. So This battery lasts longer and I am happy. There is a feature for Samsung mobiles where we can set max charging limit to 85% , it improves battery life. Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain . If I encounter anything I will update here.So finally I am happy with this product, So I will suggest you to buy this product without any doubts. Thank you Samsung"

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used.

In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends. So This battery lasts longer and I am happy. There is a feature for Samsung mobiles where we can set max charging limit to 85% , it improves battery life. Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain . If I encounter anything I will update here.So finally I am happy with this product, So I will suggest you to buy this product without any doubts. Thank you Samsung"

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung.

You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends. So This battery lasts longer and I am happy. There is a feature for Samsung mobiles where we can set max charging limit to 85% , it improves battery life. Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain . If I encounter anything I will update here.So finally I am happy with this product, So I will suggest you to buy this product without any doubts. Thank you Samsung"

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends. So This battery lasts longer and I am happy. There is a feature for Samsung mobiles where we can set max charging limit to 85% , it improves battery life. Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain .

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends.

Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain . If I encounter anything I will update here.So finally I am happy with this product, So I will suggest you to buy this product without any doubts. Thank you Samsung"

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types.

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends. So This battery lasts longer and I am happy. There is a feature for Samsung mobiles where we can set max charging limit to 85% , it improves battery life. Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain . If I encounter anything I will update here.So finally I am happy with this product, So I will suggest you to buy this product without any doubts. Thank you Samsung"

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends. So This battery lasts longer and I am happy. There is a feature for Samsung mobiles where we can set max charging limit to 85% , it improves battery life. Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain . If I encounter anything I will update here.So finally I am happy with this product, So I will suggest you to buy this product without any doubts. Thank you Samsung"

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.

I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends.

Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain .

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick.

Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends.

There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends. So This battery lasts longer and I am happy. There is a feature for Samsung mobiles where we can set max charging limit to 85% , it improves battery life. Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain . If I encounter anything I will update here.So finally I am happy with this product, So I will suggest you to buy this product without any doubts. Thank you Samsung"

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends. So This battery lasts longer and I am happy. There is a feature for Samsung mobiles where we can set max charging limit to 85% , it improves battery life. Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain . If I encounter anything I will update here.So finally I am happy with this product, So I will suggest you to buy this product without any doubts. Thank you Samsung"

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends. So This battery lasts longer and I am happy. There is a feature for Samsung mobiles where we can set max charging limit to 85% , it improves battery life. Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain . If I encounter anything I will update here.So finally I am happy with this product, So I will suggest you to buy this product without any doubts. Thank you Samsung"

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends.

Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain .

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends.

Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain . If I encounter anything I will update here.So finally I am happy with this product, So I will suggest you to buy this product without any doubts. Thank you Samsung"

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing.

It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big.

So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends. So This battery lasts longer and I am happy. There is a feature for Samsung mobiles where we can set max charging limit to 85% , it improves battery life. Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain . If I encounter anything I will update here.So finally I am happy with this product, So I will suggest you to buy this product without any doubts. Thank you Samsung"

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends. So This battery lasts longer and I am happy. There is a feature for Samsung mobiles where we can set max charging limit to 85% , it improves battery life. Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain . If I encounter anything I will update here.So finally I am happy with this product, So I will suggest you to buy this product without any doubts. Thank you Samsung"

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends. So This battery lasts longer and I am happy. There is a feature for Samsung mobiles where we can set max charging limit to 85% , it improves battery life. Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain . If I encounter anything I will update here.So finally I am happy with this product, So I will suggest you to buy this product without any doubts. Thank you Samsung"

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends.

Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain . If I encounter anything I will update here.So finally I am happy with this product, So I will suggest you to buy this product without any doubts. Thank you Samsung"

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends.

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing.

It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends. So This battery lasts longer and I am happy. There is a feature for Samsung mobiles where we can set max charging limit to 85% , it improves battery life. Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain . If I encounter anything I will update here.So finally I am happy with this product, So I will suggest you to buy this product without any doubts. Thank you Samsung"

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used.

In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends. So This battery lasts longer and I am happy. There is a feature for Samsung mobiles where we can set max charging limit to 85% , it improves battery life. Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain . If I encounter anything I will update here.So finally I am happy with this product, So I will suggest you to buy this product without any doubts. Thank you Samsung"

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung.

You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends. So This battery lasts longer and I am happy. There is a feature for Samsung mobiles where we can set max charging limit to 85% , it improves battery life. Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain . If I encounter anything I will update here.So finally I am happy with this product, So I will suggest you to buy this product without any doubts. Thank you Samsung"

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends. So This battery lasts longer and I am happy. There is a feature for Samsung mobiles where we can set max charging limit to 85% , it improves battery life. Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain .

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends.

Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain . If I encounter anything I will update here.So finally I am happy with this product, So I will suggest you to buy this product without any doubts. Thank you Samsung"

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types.

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends. So This battery lasts longer and I am happy. There is a feature for Samsung mobiles where we can set max charging limit to 85% , it improves battery life. Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain . If I encounter anything I will update here.So finally I am happy with this product, So I will suggest you to buy this product without any doubts. Thank you Samsung"

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends. So This battery lasts longer and I am happy. There is a feature for Samsung mobiles where we can set max charging limit to 85% , it improves battery life. Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain . If I encounter anything I will update here.So finally I am happy with this product, So I will suggest you to buy this product without any doubts. Thank you Samsung"

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.

I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends.

Use this option.2) Good camera quality3) Good processors, Phone never hangs or stucks.4) Minimal heating issues. I bet every phone heats up if we overuse, even this phone does, but not heavily.....So This is not a major point of concern.NegativesI haven't faced any serious negative issues in these 3 months, so I can't complain .

Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.",4,"1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick.

Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."

Good Everyday Use Phone",4,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"

Best Phone in ₹14999/- on Amazon Sale❤️ Love it.",4,"Hello!!this is Sourya Gourab,today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some  explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......👉... PROS ...👈 ▪️1) CAMERA:-  the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔  honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand. ▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍 ▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated  but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.  👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/-  is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍▪️5) BATTERY🔋:-  6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc..... ❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!!  KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇  SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️.  Regards  Sourya Gourab Nanda  (AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER)"

Latest android, samsung quality",5,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

Best Samsung model ever with so many valuable features",4,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

Budget model with Average performance but having heating issue",3,"Writing this review after 5 days of use;Cons:1. Heating issue with 5G internet browsing even while using normal apps like smule, IRCTC, amazon etc.; Taken to service centre and they say it is normal.2. Even having amoled display, screen brightness is average in daylight; but in indoors it is good.3. Weight is inconvenient to handle but nowadays most of the phones having more or less same weight.4. Not good for gaming with its configuration.5. Sluggish in playing FHD / 4k videosPros:1. Camera performance is decent at this price; Daylight photos are good but indoor and low light photos  average.  Ultra wide feature is good.2. Speaker is mono but sound is good.3. Corning gorilla glass protection available.4. Fast charging with supported adaptors ( 18 – 25 w ) achieves full charge in around 1 hour 45 mins.If you want a decent / average phone around 15-16k you may go for it."

Satisfied and Worth for Money",5,"I am not a heavy mobile user, So I want a phone which has all the features of a Good product like enough battery time, Above average camera, No hangings in the middle etc. And I found this product has reached my expectations. After usage of 3 months I am writing this ReviewPositives1) Good battery Life. I don't play Video games on mobile and rarely watches Movies or webseries except Weekends.

There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !"

Honest Review After 3 months of use",4,"I would like to rate 4/5 ( After 3 months I would like to rate 3.8 / 5 ) . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.( After 3 months am updating the review again below)October Update: -During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ₹14200 rs with card discountMy requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Cons or Disadvantages: -1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic.  Using Snapchat filter for good selfieOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile cameraBack camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respondNo more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug inSuggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display  and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‘Honest Review ’ upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.Thank you...❤️"
